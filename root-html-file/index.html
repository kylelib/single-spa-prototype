    This is the top level of the Single-Spa application. It is the master controller. You'll see this referred to as the single-spa root config 
    or root-html-file. This single-spa config file is where your applications are initialized, and an HTML page will request this config.

    We want to keep this single-spa config as small as possible since it is the master controller and could easily become a maintenance bottleneck. 
    We donâ€™t want to be constantly changing both the single-spa config and the child applications.

      Single-Spa recommends use of import maps for browser-side module support. The script tag below uses the systemJS polyfill for that support.
      Every microfrontend you want to host here should be listed in the systemjs import maps below.

      NOTE: The best way to use Single-Spa is via import maps. Currently Chrome is the only browser that has support for this, but it is 
      experimental and must be turned on via a feature flag. Therefore we'll employ a polyfills to provide import maps support for Chrome and 
      other browser. SystemJs is the most popular and widely used.

      This is a debug utility provided by the single-spa team. It's the yellow box in the lower left corner of the page. This should be
      compiled out in production. We'd use this tool to avoid having to have every micro-frontend running on our development machines.
      Instead the team responsible for, say CS WebApp, would only have that code/repo locally and point everything else, NAL, VACCN, etc to
      the development servers. Otherwise you'll have to npm run start every application locally on your machine.
